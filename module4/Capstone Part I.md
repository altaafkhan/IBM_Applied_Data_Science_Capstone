# Introduction/Business Problem
Sydney, the state capital of New South Wales also the largest city in Australia. A place that I have called home for 18 years now. A lively metropolis with lots of restaurants and bars to choose from. 

The city is packed on Friday evenings with people who work in the CBD having a few drinks or a meal with their work colleagues, friends or family. The problem I am trying to solve with this project is, with so many options available for bars and restaurants, which ones are worth 
spending Friday evening’s at based on rating and price. 

My target audience is professionals who work in the city and don’t mind paying mid to high range for venues to relax and unwind after the working week. 

# Data

This is a brief overview of data sources and how I will be using it for the Capstone Project. A full detailed step by step methodology report will be prepared during the second part of this project. 

- Australian postcode and suburb (locality) data, mainly for Sydney. Source: Matthew Proctor. Turns out this data is not freely available on Australia Post website or on Wikipedia. Luckily, I came across this website that publishes a full downloadable list, which was last updated on 16th May 2020. 
-	Foursquare data for restaurants and bars reviews

Steps:
- Extract data from both sources
- Transform the data to include elements such as latitude, longtitude, restarutant/bar ratings on Foursqaure, etc. I will require for analysis. 
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Clustering suburbs (localities) and performing analysis on them.
- Visual representation of cluster analysis to understand trending hotspots.
- Results and conclusion.

As mentioned, this is a very high-level account of methodology that will be used for this project.
