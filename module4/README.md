# Capstone Project Part I

Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve. 

For this week, you will required to submit the following:

- A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.
- A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.
